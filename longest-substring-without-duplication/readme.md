# Longest Substring Without Duplication

Category: Strings

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

without duplicate characters.


You can assume that there will only be one longest substring without duplication.


### Sample Input
```
string = "clementisacap"
```

### Sample Output
```
"mentisac"
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(min(n, a)) space - where n is the length of the input string and a is the length of the character alphabet represented in the input string
