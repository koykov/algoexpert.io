# Shortest Unique Prefixes

Category: Tries

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

  You're given an array of unique strings. Write a function that returns an
array containing the shortest unique prefix for each string.


  For example, given the strings `["algoexpert", "algorithm"]`, the
shortest prefixes that uniquely identify each string are
`["algoe", "algor"]`.


  If a string `strA` is entirely contained in another string
`strB`, then there is no completely unique prefix for
`strA`, and thus its shortest unique prefix should be its entire
self. For example, given the strings `["food", "foodie"]`, the
shortest prefixes to uniquely identify each string would be
`["food", "foodi"]`. In this example, "food"'s shortest unique
prefix must be "food" (the entire string), since it's entirely contained in
"foodie". It follows that "foodie" can't have just "food" as its shortest
unique prefix.


  Your function should return the prefixes in the corresponding order of the input
strings (i.e., the index of each prefix should be the same as the index of its corresponding
string).


  
### Sample Input #1
  ```
strings = [
  "algoexpert",
  "algorithm",
]
```
  
### Sample Output #1
  ```
[
  "algoe",
  "algor"
]
```

  
### Sample Input #2
  ```
strings = [
  "hello",
  "world",
  "he",
  "foo",
  "worldly",
  "food",
  "algoexpert"
]
```
  
### Sample Output #2
  ```
[
  "hel",
  "world",
  "he",
  "foo",
  "worldl",
  "food",
  "a"
]
```

  
### Sample Input #3
  ```
strings = [
  "foo",
  "food",
  "foods",
  "foodie"
]
```
  
### Sample Output #3
  ```
[
  "foo",
  "food",
  "foods",
  "foodi"
]
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n * m) time | O(n * m) space - where n is the length of strings, and m is the length of the longest string
