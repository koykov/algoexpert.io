# Juice Bottling

Category: Dynamic Programming

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

  You're given an array of integers `prices` of length
`n` with the retail prices of various quantities of juice. Each
index in this array corresponds to the price of that amount of juice. For
example, `prices[2]` would be the retail price of 2 units of
juice.


  You have `n - 1` total units of juice. For example, if the length
of `prices` is 5, then you would have 4 total units of juice.
Write a function to determine the optimal way to bottle the juice such that
it maximizes revenue. This function should return a list of all of the
juice quantities required in ascending order.


  Note that the first value in the `prices` array will always be 0,
because there is no value in no juice. All other values will be positive
integers. Additionally, a larger quantity of juice will not always be more
expensive than a smaller quantity. For simplicity, all of the test cases
only have one possible solution.


  
### Sample Input
  ```
prices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
```
  
### Sample Output
  ```
[1, 2] // We have 3 total units of juice,
// because the length of prices is 4.
// To maximize revenue, we split the juice into
// quantities of 1 and 2, giving a revenue of 1 + 3 = 4
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of prices
