# Stable internships

Category: Famous Algorithms

Difficulty: Medium

## Description

A company has hired N interns to each join one of N different teams. Each
intern has ranked their preferences for which teams they wish to join, and
each team has ranked their preferences for which interns they prefer.

Given these preferences, assign 1 intern to each team. These assignments
should be "stable," meaning that there is no unmatched pair of an intern and a
team such that both that intern and that team would prefer they be matched
with each other.

In the case there are multiple valid stable matchings, the solution that is
most optimal for the interns should be chosen (i.e. every intern should be
matched with the best team possible for them).

Your function should take in 2 2-dimensional lists, one for interns and
one for teams. Each inner list represents a single intern or team's preferences,
ranked from most preferable to least preferable. These lists will always be
of length N, with integers as elements. Each of these integers corresponds
to the index of the team/intern being ranked. Your function should return a
2-dimensional list of matchings in no particular order. Each matching should
be in the format [internIndex, teamIndex].


### Sample Input
```
interns = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [1, 0, 2],
  [1, 2, 0]
]
```
```
teams = [
  [2, 1, 0],
  [1, 2, 0],
  [0, 2, 1]
]
```

### Sample Output
```
// This is the most optimal solution for interns
[
  [0, 0],
  [1, 1],
  [2, 2]
]
```

```
// This is also a stable matching, but it is suboptimal for the interns
// because interns 0 and 2 could have been given better team matchings
[
  [2, 0],
  [1, 1],
  [0, 2]
]
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n^2) time | O(n^2) space - where n is the number of interns
