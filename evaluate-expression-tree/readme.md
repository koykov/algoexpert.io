# Evaluate Expression Tree

Category: Binary Trees

Difficulty: Easy

## Description

  You're given a binary expression tree. Write a function to evaluate
this tree mathematically and return a single resulting integer.


  All leaf nodes in the tree represent operands, which will always be positive
integers. All of the other nodes represent operators. There are 4 operators
supported, each of which is represented by a negative integer:


  * `-1`: Addition operator, adding the left and right subtrees.
* `-2`: Subtraction operator, subtracting the right subtree from the left subtree.
* `-3`: Division operator, dividing the left subtree by the right subtree.
      If the result is a decimal, it should be rounded towards zero.
* `-4`: Multiplication operator, multiplying the left and right subtrees.


  You can assume the tree will always be a valid expression tree. Each
operator also works as a grouping symbol, meaning the bottom of the tree is
always evaluated first, regardless of the operator.



### Sample Input
```
tree =    -1
        /     \
      -2       -3
     /   \    /  \
   -4     2  8    3
  /   \
 2     3
```

### Sample Output
```
6 // (((2 * 3) - 2) + (8 / 3))
```
## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree, and h is the height of the Binary Tree
