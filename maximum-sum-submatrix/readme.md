# Maximum Sum Submatrix

Category: Dynamic Programming

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height
and width that's filled with integers. You're also given a positive integer
`size`. Write a function that returns the maximum sum that can be
generated from a submatrix with dimensions `size * size`.

<p>For example, consider the following matrix:</p>
```
[
  [2, 4],
  [5, 6],
  [-3, 2],
]
```
<p>If `size = 2`, then the 2x2 submatrices to consider are:</p>
```
[2, 4]
[5, 6]
------
[5, 6]
[-3, 2]
```
The sum of the elements in the first submatrix is `17`, and the sum
of the elements in the second submatrix is `10`. In this example,
your function should return `17`.

Note: `size` will always be at least `1`, and the
dimensions of the input `matrix` will always be at least
`size * size`.


### Sample Input
```
matrix = 
[
  [5, 3, -1, 5],
  [-7, 3, 7, 4],
  [12, 8, 0, 0],
  [1, -8, -8, 2],
]
size = 2
```

### Sample Output
```
18
// [
//   [., ., ., .],
//   [., 3, 7, .],
//   [., 8, 0, .],
//   [., ., ., .],
// ]
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(w * h) time | O(w * h) space - where w is the width of the matrix and h is the height
