# Repair BST

Category: Binary Search Trees

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

  You're given a Binary Search Tree (BST) that has at least 2 nodes and that
only has nodes with unique values (no duplicate values). Exactly two nodes
in the BST have had their values swapped, therefore breaking the BST. Write
a function that returns a repaired version of the tree with all values on
the correct nodes.

  Your function can mutate the original tree; you do not need to create a new
one. Moreover, the shape of the returned tree should be exactly the same as
that of the original input tree.

  Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a
`left` child node, and a `right` child node. A node is
said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the BST
property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of
every node to its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the
values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
`BST` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.

  
### Sample Input
  ```
tree =    10
        /     \
       7       20
     /   \    /  \
   3     12  8   22
  /           \
2              14
```
  
### Sample Output
  ```
          10
        /     \
       7       20
     /   \    /  \
   3      8  12   22
  /           \
2              14

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the tree and h is the height of the tree
