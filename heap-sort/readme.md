# Heap Sort

Category: Sorting

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted
version of that array. Use the Heap Sort algorithm to sort the array.

If you're unfamiliar with Heap Sort, we recommend watching the Conceptual
Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.


### Sample Input
```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

### Sample Output
```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

Best: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\nAverage: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\nWorst: O(nlog(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
