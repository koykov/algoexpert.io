# Longest Palindromic Substring

Category: Strings

Difficulty: Medium

## Description

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic
substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and
backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.


You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.


### Sample Input
```
string = "abaxyzzyxf"
```

### Sample Output
```
"xyzzyx"
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input string
