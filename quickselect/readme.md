## Description

Write a function that takes in an array of distinct integers as well as an
integer `k` and that returns the kth smallest integer in that array.


The function should do this in linear time, on average.


### Sample Input
```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 7, 6, 3]
k = 3
```

### Sample Output
```
5
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\nAverage: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\nWorst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
