# Sum BSTs

Category: Binary Search Trees

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

  You're given a Binary Tree. As with any Binary Tree, this tree may contain
one or more Binary Search Trees (BSTs), and it may even be a BST itself.

  Write a function that returns the sum of all the values of nodes in this
tree which are part of a BST containing at least 3 nodes.

  Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a
`left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children
nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or
`None` / `null`.

  A BST is a special type of Binary Tree whose nodes all satisfy the BST
property. A node satisfies the BST property if its `value` is
strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its
`value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes
themselves or `None` / `null`.


  
### Sample Input #1
  ```
tree =     8
         /    \
       2       9
     /   \       \
   1     10       5    
```

  
### Sample Output #1
  ```
13 // 1, 2, and 10 form the only BST containing at least 3 nodes.

```

  
### Sample Input #2
  ```
  tree =            20
            /                \ 
           7                 10
         /   \             /     \
        0     8           5      15
            /   \       /   \   /   \
           7     9     2     5 13   22
                     /           \
                    1             14
```

  
### Sample Output #2
```
118 // The subtrees rooted at 7 and 10 are both BSTs, and their node values add up to 118.

```

  
### Sample Input #3
  ```
tree =            20
          /                \ 
         9                 10
       /   \             /     \
      0     8           6      15
          /           /   \   /   \
         7           2     5 17   22
                   /           \
                  1             14
```

  
### Sample Output #3
  ```
0 // The subtrees rooted at 8 and 2 are both BSTs, but they only contain 2 nodes each.

```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the tree and h is the height of the tree
