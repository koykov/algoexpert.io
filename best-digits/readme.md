# Best Digits

Category: Stacks

Difficulty: Medium

## Description

Write a function that takes a positive integer represented as a string
`number` and an integer `numDigits`.
Remove `numDigits` from the string so that the number represented
by the string is as large as possible afterwards.

Note that the order of the remaining digits cannot be changed. You can assume
`numDigits` will always be less than the length of `number`
and greater than or equal to 0.


### Sample Input
```
number = "462839"
numDigits = 2
```

### Sample Output
```
"6839" // remove digits 4 and 2
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input string
