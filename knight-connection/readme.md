# Knight Connection

Category: Arrays

Difficulty: Hard

## Description

  You're given the position of two knight pieces on an infinite chess board.
Write a function that returns the minimum number of turns required before
one of the knights is able to capture the other knight, assuming the knights
are working together to achieve this goal.


  The position of each knight is given as a list of 2 values, the x and y
coordinates. A knight can make 1 of 8 possible moves on any given turn. Each
of these moves involves moving in an "L" shape. This means they can either
move 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or they can move 1
square horizontally and 2 squares vertically. For example, if a knight is
currently at position [0, 0], then it can move to any of these 8 locations
on its next move:


  ```
[
  [-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, -1], [1, -2], [-1, -2], [-2, -1]
]
```

  A knight is able to capture the other knight when it is able to move onto
the square currently occupied by the other knight.


  Each turn allows each knight to move up to one time. For example, if both
knights moved towards each other once, and then knightA captures knightB on
its next move, two turns would have been used (even though knightB never
made its second move).

  
### Sample Input
  ```
knightA = [0, 0]
knightB = [4, 2]
```
  
### Sample Output
  ```
1 // knightA moves to [2, 1], knightB captures knightA on [2, 1]

```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(n * m) time | O(n * m) space - where n is horizontal distance between the knights and m is the vertical distance between the knights
